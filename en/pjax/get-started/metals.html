Industrial metals feature heavily across a wide range of industrial and commercial applications, including electrical wiring, automobiles, and batteries.</li><li>Precious metals<br/>Precious metals are harder to come by and are more valuable than industrial metals.

The most common influencing factors are:</p><ul class="checked"><li>Supply – Decline or increase in supply</li><li>Demand – Driven by industrial and commercial applications, including new technological products or fashion trends</li><li>Market volatility – Political, economic, or social instability may lead to more volatile financial markets that affect the prices of certain metals</li></ul><p>Keeping up with market news and trends in a certain sector can help you tremendously, especially if you&#x27;re just starting out.</p><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><h3 class="secondary-color">How to calculate your profits and losses</h3><p>Let&#x27;s use the XAU/USD metal pair again as an example.</p><p>Due to market volatility and gold&#x27;s reputation as a safe-haven asset, you predict that the price of gold will rise.</p><p>After you purchase one lot of XAU/USD at a price of 1,255.06 USD, the price of gold increases and you decide to sell when it reaches 1,255.80 USD. Your profit or loss comes down to the price difference multiplied by the total lots you purchased.</p><p>Your profit or loss is calculated as follows:</p><div class="gr-padding-20 fill-bg-color center-text primary-color"><p class="no-margin gr-padding-10 gr-parent"><strong>(Closing price – Opening price) x Lot units = Profit/Loss</strong></p><p class="no-margin"><strong>(1,255.80 – 1,255.06) x 100 = USD 74</strong></p></div><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><div class="gr-padding-20 fill-bg-color center-text primary-color"><div class="align-start gr-12"><div class="gr-row"><div class="gr-1 align-self-center"><div class="notice-circle">i</div></div><div class="gr-11"><p class="no-margin">Please note that one lot is equivalent to 100 units, based on our <a href="#contract-specification">contract specifications</a>.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sections invisible" id="margin-policy"><h2 class="primary-color">Metals margin policy</h2><p>Margin allows you to trade on leverage – giving you the same level of market exposure using much less capital.</p><p>For example, if you wanted to purchase 100 units of a particular asset trading at 50 USD per unit through a traditional broker, it would cost you 5,000 USD for this transaction.</p><p>With leverage, you can purchase 100 units of the same asset at a fraction of the cost.</p><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><h3 class="secondary-color">How to calculate margin</h3><p>You can determine the required margin for our metal pairs by using the formula below:</p><div class="gr-12 gr-centered gr-padding-10"><div class="mt-img l1-icon"></div><p class="fill-bg-color gr-padding-20 gr-gutter">For example, if you buy one lot of the XAU/USD pair at 300:1 leverage and a market price of 1,250.15 USD, the margin required to purchase that one lot will be calculated as follows:</p><div class="mt-img metal-icon"></div></div><p>Without margin, purchasing one lot of the XAU/USD pair will cost you:</p><div class="gr-padding-20 fill-bg-color center-text primary-color"><p class="no-margin"><strong>100 * 1250.15 = USD 125,015</strong></p></div><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><div class="gr-padding-20 fill-bg-color center-text primary-color"><div class="align-start gr-12"><div class="gr-row"><div class="gr-1 align-self-center"><div class="notice-circle">i</div></div><div class="gr-11"><p class="no-margin">Please note that one lot is equivalent to 100 units, based on our <a href="#contract-specification">contract specifications</a>.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><h3 class="secondary-color">What&#x27;s a margin call and how is it applied</h3><p>Equity is the sum of your balance and floating profit and loss (PnL). Margin level is the ratio of equity to margin. When that ratio reaches a specified percentage (usually 100%), your account will be placed under margin call. This does not affect your ability to open new positions; it serves to alert you that your floating PnL is moving lower. However, it is recommended to add funds to your account in order to keep your positions open. Alternatively, you may close losing positions.</p><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><h3 class="secondary-color">What&#x27;s a stop out level and how is it applied</h3><p>If your margin level reaches an even lower level (usually 50%), it will reach the stop out level where it is unable to sustain an open position. This will lead to some, or all your open positions being forcibly closed (also known as &quot;forced liquidation&quot;).</p><p>When your account hits the forced liquidation level, your orders and positions are forcibly closed in the following sequence:</p><ol><li>We delete an order with the largest margin reserved.</li><li>If your margin level is still under the stop out level, your next order will be deleted. However, orders without margin requirements will not be deleted.</li><li>If your margin level is still under the stop out level, we will close an open position with the largest loss.</li><li>We will continue to close open positions until your margin level becomes higher than the stop out level.</li></ol></div><div class="sections invisible" id="contract-specification"><h2 class="primary-color">Metals contract specifications</h2><div class="table-container"><table><thead><tr><th class="gr-padding-10">Symbol</th><th class="gr-padding-10">Description</th><th class="gr-padding-10 w-80">Lot size</th><th class="gr-padding-10 w-80">Minimum volume</th><th class="gr-padding-10 w-80">Volume step</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>XAG/USD</td><td>Silver vs US dollar</td><td>5000</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td>XAU/USD</td><td>Gold vs US dollar</td><td>100</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td>XPD/USD</td><td>Palladium vs US dollar</td><td>100</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.01</td></tr><tr><td>XPT/USD</td><td>Platinum vs US dollar</td><td>100</td><td>0.01</td><td>0.01</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="gr-padding-10"><div class="separator-line  "></div></div><h3 class="secondary-color">How to read the table above</h3><p>Our metal pairs are typically traded in lots.
