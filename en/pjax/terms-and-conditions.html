Such rules may change from time to time, according to market conditions and other factors. The following indicative rules are currently in place:<ul class="bullet"><li>Contracts will not usually be offered at odds under 0.05 to 1 (i.e. payouts of under 1.05 USD/GBP/EUR/AUD for each 1 USD/GBP/EUR/AUD staked).</li><li>Contracts offered by Binary Investments (Europe) Ltd have a minimum purchase price of 5 USD/GBP/EUR.</li><li>Contracts are not usually offered in the last hour of trade of any given market (for foreign exchange markets, the restriction may be extended up to 3 hours).</li><li>Contracts will not usually be offered when the underlying market is at its intraday high or intraday low.</li><li>Contracts will not usually be offered during the first 10 minutes of market trade.</li><li>During fast markets (i.e. periods of very fast market movements), contracts may be offered at prices more unfavourable than those offered in usual market conditions.</li><li>Certain limits are imposed as to the acceptable levels for barrier/strike prices of contracts. Typically, the barrier/strike may not be too close nor too far from the current underlying market level.</li><li>Contracts may not expire on a weekend; therefore, the expiry date of a contract may be pushed back to the following Monday in the event of a contract expiry date falling on a Saturday or a Sunday.</li><li>Market prices are updated at most once per second.

Clients should note that different markets may close at different times during the day due to local trading hours and time zones.</p><p>For forex quotes, the closing times are defined by the Company as shown in the market opening times section of the website.

The calculation will include a bias in favour of the Company. The financial contract prices (or the payout amounts) offered to clients speculating on market or index prices may substantially differ from prices available in the primary markets where commodities or contracts thereupon are traded, due to the bias favouring the Company in the price calculation system referred to above.</p><p>The charting data made available to clients by the Company is indicative only and may at times differ from the real market values. The Company&#x27;s decision as to the calculation of a financial contract price will be final and binding.

DIEL is authorised by the MFSA to deal on own account (i.e. offer and act as counterparty to trades) and to execute orders on behalf of other clients; both services are in relation to financial derivative products relating to foreign exchange, indices and other financial products or assets (&quot;Financial Products&quot;). DIEL is not authorised to and does not offer investment, financial, legal, tax, regulatory, and/or other types of advice or state an opinion in relation to a Transaction under any circumstances. Clients should get independent advice from an investment adviser if they have any doubts about dealing in financial products.</p><p>From time to time, DIEL may decide to provide the client with written or video information, which DIEL may publish on its website or provide to the client in any other manner. DIEL will endeavour to ensure the accuracy and completeness of this information, but it will not constitute independent investment research or investment advice provided by DIEL to the client.</p><p>In providing these services, DIEL is bound by the Act, any applicable regulations, by-laws, licence conditions, guidelines, exchange requirements, and other provisions or market practices (the &quot;Rules&quot;). In the event of conflict between these ST&amp;Cs and the Rules, the latter should prevail.</p><h2 data-anchor="restrictions">Restrictions</h2><p>Residents of countries that have been identified by the FATF as having strategic deficiencies shall be restricted from opening an account with Deriv Investments (Europe) Ltd.</p><h2 data-anchor="client-classification">Client classification</h2><p>Under the Rules, clients may be categorised into one of the following three categories:</p><ul class="bullet"><li>Retail clients</li><li>Professional clients</li><li>Eligible counterparties</li></ul><p>The level of protection offered and due to each client depends on the category to which each client is assigned. Retail clients benefit from the highest degree of protection. The Company will assess the client&#x27;s knowledge and experience versus the appropriateness of the requested service/investment product.</p><ol><li><h4>Retail clients</h4><p>Unless otherwise advised, DIEL shall treat a client as a retail client. Clients may also request, by writing to DIEL, to change the category in which they have been classified, and this may have an effect on the level of protection afforded to them. DIEL will assess the client&#x27;s knowledge and experience versus the appropriateness of the requested service/investment product.</p><p>Clients hereby declare that they are dealing with DIEL outside the scope of their economic or professional activity, and DIEL will therefore treat the client as an individual retail client for the purposes of EMIR compliance, unless advised otherwise.</p></li><li><h4>Professional clients</h4><p>If the client asks to be treated as a professional client, they need to meet certain specified quantitative and qualitative criteria. On the basis of the client&#x27;s request to be categorised as professional, the Company undertakes an assessment of the client&#x27;s expertise, knowledge, and experience to determine whether they fall within this category and whether they are able to make their own investment decisions and understand the risks involved. If the relevant criteria are not met, the Company reserves the right to choose whether to provide its services under this requested classification.</p><p>Professional clients are offered the possibility to request reclassification, and thus increase the level of regulatory protection afforded, at any time during the relationship.</p><p>DIEL shall not be obliged to provide professional clients with the following:<ol><li>Assessment of appropriateness of the requested service or product as DIEL assumes that the client appreciates the risks associated with such investment services and products offered by the Company</li><li>Risk warnings and notices related to Transactions and investments in the proposed instruments</li><li>Educational material</li><li>Compensation under Investor Compensation Scheme</li></ol></p></li><li><h4>Eligible counterparties</h4><p>When a client is classified as an Eligible Counterparty, DIEL shall not provide them with<ol><li>Best execution requirements</li><li>Assessment of appropriateness of the requested service or product, as DIEL assumes that the client appreciates risk disclosures associated with the requested investment services and products offered by the Company</li><li>Risk warnings and notices related to the client&#x27;s Transactions</li><li>Client reporting</li><li>The Investor Compensation Scheme</li></ol></p></li></ol><p>DIEL reserves the right to accept or refuse any requests for change in classification.</p><p>DIEL is entitled under the Rules to rely upon information provided by clients. Clients should ensure that they provide DIEL with accurate and complete information and notify DIEL in the event that any information supplied to DIEL changes. Clients should note that if they provide DIEL with inaccurate information, or if they fail to notify DIEL of any changes to information previously supplied by them, this may adversely affect the quality of the services that DIEL can provide.</p><p>Clients are also advised that their rights may be prejudiced if they provide the wrong information as the Company would not be in a position to act in their best interests.</p><h2 data-anchor="appropriateness-test">Appropriateness test</h2><p>In the course of provision of services, DIEL shall, where applicable, conduct an appropriateness test in order to determine whether, in DIEL&#x27;s view and on the basis of the information provided by the client, the client has the necessary knowledge and experience in the investment field to understand the risks involved in the specific type of product or service offered or demanded.</p><p>Where DIEL considers, on the basis of the information provided by the client that the client does not possess the knowledge and experience to appreciate the risks associated with an investment in the proposed instrument, DIEL will issue a warning to the client. Such a warning shall be displayed on the website.</p><p>Where DIEL does not manage to obtain sufficient information to assess the appropriateness of the product or service for the client, DIEL will similarly inform the client that DIEL is not in a position to assess appropriateness.</p><h2 data-anchor="best-execution-policy">Best execution policy</h2><p>Subject to any specific instructions which may be provided by the client, when executing client orders, DIEL will take all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible results for the client. The best possible results will be determined in terms of total consideration, that is, the price of the instrument and the costs related to execution, which shall include all expenses incurred by the client that are directly related to the execution of the order.</p><p>Other best execution factors, such as speed of execution, likelihood of execution and settlement, size, nature, or any other considerations relevant to the execution of a particular order, may also be applied by DIEL in order to obtain the best possible results for the client.</p><p>Since DIEL exclusively deals on own account in Financial Products, this means that DIEL acts as the execution venue, and accordingly all transactions entered into with DIEL will be executed outside a regulated market (stock exchange) or multilateral trading facility.</p><p>The full version of DIEL&#x27;s best execution policy is available on request.</p><h2 data-anchor="clients-money">Clients&#x27; money</h2><p>Monies deposited by clients with DIEL in advance of a trade or pending withdrawal is treated by DIEL as clients&#x27; money. DIEL holds such monies in pooled or omnibus clients&#x27; money bank accounts opened with banks or other institutions (&quot;Institutions&quot;), segregated from DIEL&#x27;s own money. Such clients&#x27; money bank accounts may be opened with EEA Institutions or Institutions outside the EEA. Where clients&#x27; money is held with non-EEA Institutions, this means that such accounts will be subject to laws other than those of an EEA member state and clients&#x27; rights may differ accordingly.</p><p>The Financial Products that DIEL offers to deal in are contracts entered into between clients and DIEL. Under these contracts and subject to the specific terms of the relevant contract, in consideration for the premium or price that clients pay DIEL, DIEL promises to pay clients a certain amount if the reference assets or measurements perform in a particular manner. These contracts accordingly are not instruments that DIEL holds on clients&#x27; behalf and neither benefits from clients&#x27; assets protection in the event of DIEL&#x27;s insolvency. Similarly, the premium or price that clients pay to take out a trade is not held as clients&#x27; money but as consideration for DIEL&#x27;s undertaking to pay.</p><p>The client acknowledges and agrees to the following:<ul class="bullet"><li>The Company will not pay interest on the client money.</li><li>Where the client&#x27;s obligations to the Company are due and payable, the Company shall cease to treat as client money the amount equal to the amount of such obligations.</li><li>The Company may use the client money for the purposes of meeting obligations that are incurred by the Company in connection with the margining, guaranteeing, securing, transferring, adjusting, or settling of the client&#x27;s dealings in derivatives.</li></ul></p><h2 data-anchor="investor-compensation-scheme">Investor Compensation Scheme</h2><p>DIEL forms part of <a href="http://www.compensationschemes.org.mt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Investor Compensation Scheme</a> (the &quot;Scheme&quot;), which is a rescue fund for investors that are clients of failed investment firms licensed by the MFSA. The Scheme covers 90% of the Company&#x27;s net liability to a client in respect of investments that qualify for compensation under the Investment Services Act subject to a maximum payment to any one person of €20,000. The Scheme is based on EC Directive 97/9.</p><p>Cover is made available on the basis of the depositor rather than on the basis of the number of deposits, meaning that if an individual has multiple accounts, they will only be covered up to €20,000 on the global amount.

For example, these include laws relating to advertising, data protection, privacy, and social responsibility.</p><h2 data-anchor="responsible-trading">Responsible trading</h2><p>We describe the risks as well as the potential rewards that apply to our services.  We emphasise that clients must have a clear understanding of those risks. Recognising that trading can be addictive, we emphasise that clients must trade only with money that they can afford to lose, and they must never trade with borrowed funds. They should put a limit on their winnings, and they should never trade when they are tired or under the influence of alcohol or medication.</p><p>Affiliates have a particular responsibility to explain our services clearly and accurately. Of course, we want our clients to share the excitement of trading. However, they need to understand clearly that they may win as well as lose. It is essential to avoid exaggerated descriptions of potential winnings.</p><p>Affiliates are required to display a risk warning on their website and associated materials, with wording such as the following:</p><p>The products offered on the Binary.com website include binary options, contracts for difference (&quot;CFDs&quot;) and other complex derivatives. Trading binary options may not be suitable for everyone. Trading CFDs carries a high level of risk since leverage can work both to your advantage and disadvantage. As a result, the products offered on the website may not be suitable for all investors because of the risk of losing all of your invested capital. You should never invest money that you cannot afford to lose, and never trade with borrowed money. Before trading in the complex products offered, please be sure to understand the risks involved.</p><h2 data-anchor="transparency">Transparency</h2><p>Recognising the complexities of the financial markets, we describe our trading options fairly and in detail. We include accurate product descriptions on our website, as well as free webinars. We offer clients the opportunity to set up virtual accounts in order to experiment with the system free of charge. We encourage our clients to study all these sources of information carefully before they trade.</p><p>This is a continuation of the same point. Binary.com offers clients a variety of ways of learning how to trade responsibly. Affiliates should make sure that they do learn, for example by encouraging them to build up their expertise with a virtual account rather than trading with real funds straightaway.</p><h2 data-anchor="reliability">Reliability</h2><p>We keep our promises. When clients trade on our system, we clearly define what they may win, what they may lose, and in what circumstances. If they win, we pay out their rewards quickly and efficiently.</p><p>This is one of our core commitments to clients.</p><h2 data-anchor="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h2><p>We will not disclose any confidential information that comes into our possession through our client relationships unless required to do so by a regulator or law enforcement authority.</p><p>A regulator or law enforcement authority might ask us to share otherwise confidential information in connection with investigations into a suspected criminal offence, particularly money-laundering (see below). If you receive a request to share confidential information, you should immediately inform <a href="mailto:compliance@binary.com">compliance@binary.com</a> who will give guidance on how to respond.</p><h2 data-anchor="no-bribery">No bribery</h2><p>We do not pay bribes in any form, and we do not permit anyone else to pay bribes on our behalf. This includes an absolute prohibition on bribes to government officials as well as people in positions of responsibility in the private sector.</p><p>We recognise that bribes may take the form of gifts in kind as well as financial payments. We will not offer or accept gifts that could affect either side’s impartiality, influence a business decision or lead to the improper performance of an official duty.</p><p>Binary.com’s refusal to pay bribes is an essential part of our ethical commitment. Similarly, we do not permit our business partners to pay bribes when acting on our behalf.</p><h2 data-anchor="anti-money-laundering">Anti-money laundering</h2><p>We will not permit our products or payment facilities to be used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, or other criminal activities. Where appropriate, we will conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) checks on our clients. We will report suspicious transactions to relevant authorities.</p><p>Clients may trade on our platforms only when they are using their own money and are drawing on funds that have been acquired honestly. If you have any suspicion that clients are using money that has been acquired dishonestly, you must inform <a href="mailto:compliance@binary.com">compliance@binary.com</a>.  In such cases, we may decide to conduct checks on the client’s status and background. Binary.com management will decide what information needs to be reported to government officials and through what channels.</p><h2 data-anchor="no-insider-trading">No insider trading</h2><p>We prohibit all forms of insider trading. This means that clients are not permitted to trade on the basis of knowledge that is not publicly available. For example, such knowledge may include confidential information gained through their work. </p><p>Special conditions apply to clients who are employed in the banking and/or finance sector. They may not conduct trades through our website without the knowledge of their employer. They must check that any such trading is in accordance with their employer&#x27;s policies.</p><p>You must ensure that potential clients are aware of the prohibition on insider trading based on confidential information. If you have any suspicion that such trading is taking place you must inform <a href="mailto:compliance@binary.com">compliance@binary.com</a>.</p><h2 data-anchor="fair-competition">Fair Competition</h2><p>Binary.com prohibits anti-competitive agreements or conduct, including fixing prices, restricting the supply of services, price rigging and market sharing.

Orders</h2><ol><li>Order execution/cancellation/modification<ol><li>The client acknowledges that it is their responsibility to understand the features, characteristics, terms, and conditions of an Order and the implications of executing an Order before they place an Order with the Company.</li><li>Subject to network latency, the Company endeavours to execute the client&#x27;s Order within a reasonable time from the time that they trigger the Order, at the price nearest to the client&#x27;s specified price. The Company does not guarantee that a transaction will be opened/closed following an Order being triggered by the client at their specified price. This can happen under certain trading conditions when there are sharp price movements in the market. In that case, the Company has the right to execute the Order at the first available price.</li><li>The Company endeavours to open or close the transaction to which the client&#x27;s Order relates at a price reasonably available to the Company, acting in accordance with the Company&#x27;s duty of best execution. Best execution means that, when executing Orders, the Company must take all sufficient steps to obtain the best possible result for the client, taking into account the price, costs, speed, likelihood of execution and settlement, size, nature, or any other consideration relevant to the execution of the Order.</li><li>The Company Prices are determined by reference to the price of the Underlying Instrument which is quoted on external exchanges or dealing facilities that Binary.com selects at the Company&#x27;s discretion. The Company&#x27;s IT infrastructure and price aggregator system facilitate the reception of quotes from shortlisted prime brokers, who act as liquidity providers for the Company and the delivery of the quotes, derived with reference against relevant benchmark and markets, to the client. The client acknowledges that the Company Prices may differ from the Bids and Asks made available by external exchanges or dealing facilities and the Company is not liable for any losses that the client might incur arising from such differences. This clause does not apply to Synthetic Indices.</li></ol></li></ol><h2 data-anchor="types-of-orders">Types of Orders</h2><ol><li><h4>Market Orders</h4><p>A Market Order is an Order to buy or sell at the available market price, which results from the aggregation of prices and volumes received from third-party liquidity providers.</p></li><li><h4>Pending Orders</h4><p>A Pending Order is the trader&#x27;s instruction to a brokerage company to buy or sell a security in future, under pre-defined conditions, when price reaches a specific level.</p><ol><li>The Company may, at its absolute discretion, accept a Stop Order, a Limit Order, or a Stop Limit Order from the client.</li><li>The client may specify their instruction of a Stop Order or apply for a Limit Order for a limited duration or for an indefinite period (a &quot;good till cancelled&quot; or &quot;GTC&quot; Order).<ol><li>In the case of a Stop Order, the client acknowledges that the Company will endeavour to fill the Order at a price equal to the one that the client has specified. However, if the specified price is unavailable, a less favourable price may be quoted. In other words, the Order is executed either at the price equal to the specified one or worse than that (slippage). The execution of Stop Orders is guaranteed.</li><li>In the case of a Limit Order, the client acknowledges that the Company will endeavour to fill the Order at a level that is the same or better than the Limit the client has specified, subject to the availability of the Limit Price.</li></ol></li><li>Stop Limit Orders are a combination of Stop and Limit Orders. If the price reaches (or passes) the Stop Price, a Limit Order is placed at the specified price, which will be filled at a price equal or better than the specified price. </li><li>A Take Profit Order is intended for gaining profit when the financial instrument price has reached a certain level. Execution of this Order results in the complete closing of the whole position. It is always connected to an Open Position or a Pending Order.</li><li>A Stop Loss Order is intended for minimising losses when the financial instrument price moves in an unprofitable direction. The execution of this Order results in the complete closing of the whole position. It is always connected to an Open Position or a Pending Order.</li><li>The client may not cancel or amend the level of their Stop and Limit Order once the level has been reached.</li><li>The client acknowledges that it is their responsibility to cancel the Stop or Limit Order if they do not want the Stop or Limit Order to remain valid. If the client fails to cancel the Stop or Limit Order, the Company shall be entitled, at its absolute discretion, to treat the Stop or Limit Order as an instruction to enter into a new transaction for the client if and when the Company quote reaches or goes beyond the level of the Stop or Limit Order.</li><li>The client acknowledges that the Company reserves the right to establish a minimum and maximum transaction size, as well as a total net position size, which may be subject to alteration, and that the Company will only execute Orders that fall within the range of the minimum and maximum transaction sizes.</li><li>The Company may, at its absolute discretion, disregard the client&#x27;s Order if an Event takes place resulting in it no longer being practicable to act on the client&#x27;s Order after indicating an acceptance of their Order.</li></ol></li></ol><h2 data-anchor="margin">F. Margin and Leverage</h2><ol><li>General provisions<p>The Margin used in Margin calculations will be whichever is bigger: the Margin implied by the account&#x27;s Leverage or the symbol&#x27;s Margin. The account has a specific Margin, but symbol&#x27;s Margin may vary. </p><ol><li>Prior to placing an Order, which results in opening a position, the client acknowledges that it is their responsibility to ensure that their Account Free Margin is sufficient to cover the Margin required in relation to the opening of the position (the &quot;Margin Requirement&quot;), and to continuously meet the Margin Requirement.</li><li>To maintain Open Positions, the client is required to have sufficient Account Equity to cover any Margin Requirement. If a client&#x27;s Margin Level is less than the Margin Level set for their account, the client has entered into a Margin Call and is required to increase their Margin Level above the account&#x27;s specified level in order to avoid a Stop Out to occur. The client may not be able to place an Order to open a transaction unless there is sufficient Account Equity to cover the Total Margin.</li><li>The client acknowledges that it is their responsibility to monitor their Account Balance and Margin Requirement, and the Company is not under any obligation to keep the client informed (i.e. to make a Margin Call).</li></ol></li><li>Margin Requirement and calculation<p><ol><li>Margin Requirement is the amount that the client needs to have in their account prior to entering into a trade and it is a percentage of the value of that trade. Margin Requirement will continue to increase/decrease in accordance with the volume and direction of the Open Positions.</li><li>The Company may modify Margin Requirements for any Open Positions or new Orders at its sole discretion. Formulas for Margin Requirements published on the website are indicative only and may be changed by the Company at its discretion at any time, due to changing market conditions or other factors.</li><li>Whilst the Company endeavours to close out the client&#x27;s Open Positions if and when the Margin Level for their MT5 Real Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, the company does not guarantee that the client&#x27;s Open Positions will be closed when the Margin Level for their MT5 Real Account reaches the Stop Out Level.</li><li>For fully covered accounts, no Margin will be charged on open positions. However, swaps and other applicable fees can cause the client&#x27;s Account Equity to turn negative. In that case, the Stop Out process will be triggered.</li><li>The Company reserves the right to charge the Margin per each hedged lot of a position.</li></ol></p></li><li>Stop Out Level<ol><li>If the Margin Level for the client&#x27;s MT5 Real Account reaches or falls below the Stop Out Level, this will be classified as an Event of Default. In such circumstances, Open Positions are automatically closed in the following order: (i) the server analyses those Orders that are not under execution at the moment; (ii) the server deletes Orders with the largest Margin; (iii) if the client&#x27;s Margin Level is still under the Stop Out Level, the next Order is deleted (Orders without Margin Requirements are not deleted); (iv) if the client&#x27;s Margin Level is still under the Stop Out Level, the server closes a position with the largest loss; (v) Open Positions are closed until the client&#x27;s Margin Level becomes higher than the Stop Out Level. Additionally, for fully hedged positions, Stop Out will be performed on accounts having Open Positions, zero Margin (positions are covered), and negative equity.</li><li>The default Stop Out Level applicable to the client&#x27;s account is published on the Company website. However, the default Stop Out Level is subject to alteration at the Company&#x27;s absolute discretion. Any changes to the Stop Out Level will take effect immediately. The Company will endeavour to notify the client of an alteration to the default Stop Out Level by publishing the revised default Stop Out Level on the Company website. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to check the Company website regularly and remain informed about the default Stop Out Level.</li><li>The Stop Out Level applicable to the client&#x27;s MT5 Real Account may differ from the default Stop Out Level published on the Company website.</li></ol></li><li>Negative Balance Protection<p>The Company has a Stop Out policy which prevents the client from losing more than they have deposited. However, in the event that the client&#x27;s Open Positions are not closed when the Margin Level for their MT5 Real Account reaches the Stop Out Level, the Company, at its sole discretion, may waive the client&#x27;s negative balance by crediting their account if their Account Balance goes into a negative balance. The negative balance is determined by aggregating all the negative balances incurred over a 24-hour period across all accounts held by the client. The client acknowledges that, unless they are a retail customer of Binary Investments (Europe) Ltd or a client of Binary (Europe) Ltd, the offer of the negative balance protection by the Company to the client is at the Company&#x27;s sole discretion and the Company reserves the right to change the features and eligibility criteria of the negative balance protection at any time. The provisions of the negative balance protection do not apply in the following situations:<ol><li>When a force majeure event occurs</li><li>When the market conditions or market movements/volatility are abnormal</li><li>When the client opens any transactions in relation to Prohibited Trades</li><li>When the client is a professional client</li><li>Where the negative balance is connected to or a result of functional limitations and/or malfunction of the MT5 trading platform</li><li>When a negative balance results from the breach of any of the terms of this agreement by the client</li></ol></p></li><li>Transfer of funds<ol><li>The client may make Margin Payments by transferring funds from their Binary.com account to their MT5 Real Account. In the event that there are insufficient funds in the client&#x27;s Binary.com account to fund their MT5 Real Account, they may make Margin Payments by funding their Binary.com account and transferring the funds from their Binary.com account to their MT5 Real Account.</li><li>Margin Payments are due immediately and shall be received in full by the Company.</li></ol></li></ol><h2 data-anchor="regulatory-provisions">G. Regulatory provisions</h2><ol><li>Potential conflicts of interest<ol><li>The Margin trading services described in this agreement are conducted over the counter (&quot;OTC&quot;). </li><li>The client acknowledges that the Company will determine, at its discretion, the transactions that will be kept in the Company&#x27;s own book (known as B booking) and the transactions that will be passed through to the prime brokers who act as liquidity providers for the Company (known as A booking). For the former, the Company is the counterparty in these transactions, and a correlation exists between the profit/loss made by the client and the profit/loss made by the Company. At any point in time, the Company may be entering into or may have entered into transactions with a large number of clients, each of whose interests may diverge from those of other clients. As such, the Company may be holding Open Positions that may not be aligned with the client&#x27;s objectives/interests as an individual client of the Company.</li><li>Whilst the Company endeavours to take all reasonable and sufficient steps, as required by applicable laws and regulations, to identify potential conflicts of interests between the Company and its clients, or between one client and another, that arise in the course of providing the Margin trading services as described in this agreement by establishing and implementing policies and procedures, it is possible that the Company may execute certain Orders which may have other direct or indirect material interests.</li><li>Given the Company&#x27;s role as a Margin trading service provider as described in this agreement, the Company seeks to avoid undue market influence to the extent consistent with the client&#x27;s trading needs and the Company&#x27;s risk management policies and procedures.

As a trader, the client should always maintain the appropriate levels of Margin in their trading account as the recommended method of their own risk management.</p><p>If the client&#x27;s usable Margin drops below 100%, a Margin Call mode will be triggered and maintained till the level of 50%. In the event that the client&#x27;s Margin Level is equal to, or drops below 50%, the Company will initiate the closing of the client&#x27;s current Open Positions, starting from the most unprofitable, until the required Margin Level is achieved. In such events, the positions will be automatically closed at the current market price at that point in time.</p><p>In exceptional circumstances, where there is a price change in the underlying that is sufficiently large and sudden, gapping can occur. In such cases, the automatic Margin close-out protection might fail, causing the client&#x27;s Account Balance to fall below zero. For this purpose, a Negative Balance Protection mechanism has been introduced. Negative Balance Protection provides a &#x27;backstop&#x27; in case of extreme market conditions and ensures that the client&#x27;s maximum losses from trading CFDs, including all related costs, are limited to the balance available on the client&#x27;s CFD account. Therefore, the client can never lose more money than the total sum invested for trading CFDs; if the client&#x27;s CFD account balance falls below zero, the Company will compensate the negative balance as soon as possible without any additional cost to the client.</p><p>Negative Balance Protection does not apply to the clients categorised as Professional Traders, who can still lose more money than their available balance.</p></li></ol></li><li><strong>Account closure</strong><p>If the client wishes to withdraw funds from their MT5 Real Account and/or close their MT5 Real Account, the client may notify the Company by contacting the helpdesk at <a href="mailto:support@binary.com">support@binary.com</a>.

Reasons for differences in feed providers include:</p><ul><li>For forex: The forex market is an OTC (over the counter) market, where banks and other major financial institutions trade currencies amongst themselves without there being any central clearing house. Accordingly, there is no &#x27;official&#x27; price source for forex quotes. Different data feeds will contain quotes from a different sub-set of international banks. Accordingly, prices may differ among providers, depending on which bank(s) they obtain prices from.</li><li>Market-closing times: The client is asked to refer to <a href="/en/resources/market_timesws.html">Trading times</a> page for the exact time of settlement for all contracts. Other websites may adopt a different convention (for example, some websites choose 4 o&#x27;clock NY time or 5 o&#x27;clock London time). As a result, the open, high, low, and closing prices displayed on the Company&#x27;s website may differ from those on other websites, due to the market-closing time convention.</li><li>Use of Bid/Ask: When the market is illiquid, the data feed may contain many Bids and Asks, without there actually being any traded price for quite a while. By taking an average of the Bid/Ask (i.e. bid + ask, divided by 2), a market quote is generated that reflects the current market, without it actually being a traded price. The Company&#x27;s system will generate prices from these Bids and Asks, whereas other websites might not. As a result, the Company&#x27;s website might display ticks that do not appear in the data feeds of other websites.</li></ul><p>The Company&#x27;s data feed is designed to be one of the best and most robust available for a trading environment.</p><h2 data-anchor="weekend-quotes">Weekend quotes</h2><p>The client is asked to note that weekend quotes are ignored for the purpose of contract settlement. During weekends, the forex markets may occasionally generate prices; however, these prices are often artificial (traders sometimes take advantage of the illiquidity of the markets during weekends to push prices up or down). To avoid settling prices based on such artificial prices, it is Company&#x27;s policy not to count weekend prices towards contract settlement values (except for Synthetic Indices, which are open during weekends).</p></div></div><div id="privacy-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="security-and-privacy">Security and privacy</h2><p>The Company recognises the importance of protecting the client&#x27;s personal and financial information.</p><p>All the information that the Company obtains about the client assists the Company in servicing the client and the client&#x27;s account. The Company knows that the client may be concerned about what the Company does with this information.</p><p>The Company has outlined the Company&#x27;s privacy practices for the client as follows:</p><h2 data-anchor="use-of-information">Use of information</h2><p>The Company operates in full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable Data Protection laws. These regulatory measures place obligations on users of personal data like the Company. They also lay down the principles for fair and lawful processing of all the information that the Company acquires.</p><p>It is the Company&#x27;s commitment to safeguard the client&#x27;s privacy online at all times. The Company only uses the client&#x27;s personal information to help the Company service the client&#x27;s account, to improve the Company&#x27;s services to the client, and to provide the client with products that the client has requested. The Company does not sell the client&#x27;s personal information to third parties, but the Company may provide it to payment providers to facilitate transactions on the client&#x27;s account.</p><p>The client&#x27;s personal information is used primarily as a way of validating the client as the legitimate account owner and proper recipient of withdrawal payments. The Company also uses this information to process the client&#x27;s trades. The Company collects from the client all personal and financial data directly relating to the client when the client fills in the Company&#x27;s account opening form. In all instances, the client has either a legal or a contractual obligation to provide the Company with the information. If such information is not provided, the Company will be unable to provide the client with its services.</p><p>The Company reserves the right to request further information from the client whenever deemed appropriate under the circumstances. For example, the Company may ask the client to send the Company additional acceptable documents to confirm the authenticity of the client&#x27;s account details or of any withdrawal request.</p><p>The Company holds all the personal data that the Company collects from the client with due diligence and only processes them for purposes as required or allowed by law. This includes the process of obtaining and sharing of certain information with third parties for credit or identity checks to comply with legal and regulatory obligations. In certain cases, the Company may process the client&#x27;s data to fulfill the Company&#x27;s contractual obligations with the client.</p><p>The Company also collects basic tax residence information for the purposes of CRS/FATCA compliance. The tax information that the client provides may only be disclosed to the authorities who are legally charged with collecting this information for CRS/FATCA reporting, and Binary.com will only do so to the extent that it is legally obliged to collect it from the clients and disclose it to the authorities. The Company does not use, disclose, or process this information in any other way at any time.</p><p>The client may update the client&#x27;s personal information at any time by logging in to the &quot;Settings&quot; section of the client&#x27;s account. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to ensure that Binary.com is promptly and continually informed of any change in the client&#x27;s personal information. The client should note that if the client provides the Company with inaccurate information, or if the client fails to notify the Company of any changes to the information previously supplied by the client, this may adversely affect the quality of the services that the Company can provide.</p><h2 data-anchor="profiling-and-categorisation">Profiling and categorisation</h2><p>The Company collects and assesses the client&#x27;s data to profile the client in relation to the Company&#x27;s products.

This includes any of the Company&#x27;s business associates or payment providers within or outside of the EEA, including countries that might not offer an equivalent level of protection of personal data. In all instances, the Company places a contractual obligation on such third parties to offer the same level of rights and protection as stipulated in the GDPR.</p><p>The client also has the right to request copies of any personal information that the client has provided to the Company and to request that the Company transmit such information to other service providers.</p><h2 data-anchor="consent">Consent</h2><p>When the client opens an account with the Company, the Company will request the client&#x27;s consent for the distribution of marketing materials to the e-mail address that the client provides to the Company upon sign-up.</p><h2 data-anchor="right-of-object">Right to object</h2><p>The client has the right to object to the direct distribution of marketing materials.

In both cases, the Company will refrain from distributing marketing materials to the client.</p><h2 data-anchor="access-to-personal-data">Access to personal data</h2><p>Access to the client&#x27;s personal data is strictly prohibited, with the exception of key Binary.com personnel and only as needed for the performance of their duties.</p><p>If Binary.com is legally required to disclose the client&#x27;s personal or financial information by law, regulation, or pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction or a governmental agency, the Company will promptly notify the client, as it deems appropriate, to give the client the opportunity to seek protection for the information. The Company will do so unless legally prohibited. Such required disclosure shall not be interpreted as a breach of this terms and conditions agreement.</p><p>The client also has the right to request that the Company copy, modify, or remove the client&#x27;s personal information as long as such actions do not breach any legal or regulatory obligations that the Company may have.</p></div><h2 data-anchor="data-retention">Data retention</h2><p>If the client chooses to close the client&#x27;s Binary.com account, the client&#x27;s data will be kept only until the Company&#x27;s legal and regulatory obligations on data retention are met. The Company will delete the client&#x27;s data once the applicable retention period expires.</p><h2 data-anchor="security-statement">Security statement</h2><p>Taking the following measures, the Company is committed to making sure that the client&#x27;s personal data and transactions are secure:</p><ol><li>The client&#x27;s password and login ID are unique, and passwords are hashed so that not even Binary.com staff can read them. This is the reason why the Company cannot retrieve the client&#x27;s password and has to issue the client with a new one, sent to the client&#x27;s email address, if the client cannot recall it.</li><li>The Company maintains customer balances in cash or cash equivalent. The Company ensures that 100% of each customer&#x27;s balance is available for immediate withdrawal, subject to verification.</li><li>All credit card details are submitted directly to the Visa/Mastercard network using the latest SSL encryption technology, in accordance with bank policies.</li><li>The Company&#x27;s information security policies are based on industry best practices in access control and business continuity.</li><li>The Company uses identity verification services and real-time fraud detection measures to help protect the client from unauthorised access to the client&#x27;s account.

The Company also maintains procedures to manage actual or potential conflicts. This includes procedures to maintain appropriate independence among members of the Company&#x27;s staff who are involved in potentially conflicting activities. Such independence-upholding procedures can be followed, for example, through the operation of information barriers, physical separation of staff, the segregation of duties and responsibilities, and the maintenance of a policy of independence, which requires the Company&#x27;s staff, when providing services to a client, to act in the best interests of the client and to disregard any conflicts of interest, or in some circumstances, to decline to act for a client or potential client in order to avoid conflicts of interest.</p><h2 data-anchor="disclosure-general">General disclosure</h2><p>The organisational and administrative arrangements established by the Company to prevent or manage a conflict are not sufficient to ensure, with reasonable confidence, that the risk of damage to the interest of the client will be prevented.

Any decision to open an account and to use the Company&#x27;s products or services is the client&#x27;s. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to understand the risks involved with the Company&#x27;s products or services.</p><p>During the application process, the Company may ask the client for information about the client&#x27;s background, experience, and investment assets and earnings. The Company does not monitor on the client&#x27;s behalf whether the amount of money that the client has sent to the Company or the client&#x27;s profits or losses are consistent with that information.

Like traditional options, binary options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, or stock indices; however, one of the most significant differences between binary options and traditional options, among others, is that there can only be two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount as determined in each option.</p><p>Trading in binary options is speculative and involves a high degree of risk that can result in the loss of the client&#x27;s entire investment. Therefore, trading in binary options is appropriate only for persons that understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal, and other risks involved in such transactions. The client should be satisfied that binary options trading is suitable for the client in light of the client&#x27;s investment circumstances and attitude towards risk before trading. The client should not engage in speculative binary options trading unless the client understands the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If the client is in any doubt as to whether Binary Option trading is appropriate and suitable for the client, the client should seek independent advice from an investment consulting professional. Binary.com does not provide such advice. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility, taking into account the client&#x27;s personal circumstances and investment resources, to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying to engage in binary options with Binary.com and prior to making any individual order. Where the client does not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with Binary.com or in making any individual order, the client should seek advice and consultation from an independent investment advisor. If the client continues to not understand the risks involved in trading in binary options, the client should not trade at all.</p><p>The client is advised that the binary options offered by Binary.com are not traded under the rules of any recognised, designated, or regulated exchange. Consequently, engaging in binary options trading may expose the client to substantially greater risks than the investments that are so traded.</p><p>The client is warned of the following additional risks:</p><p>Derivative investment instruments such as binary options and related markets can be highly volatile. The prices of the underlying instrument that a Binary Option refers to may fluctuate rapidly and over wide ranges and may reflect unforeseeable events or changes in conditions, none of which can be controlled by the client or Binary.com.</p><p>Binary.com tries to maintain a reasonable relation between the quoted prices of each underlying asset that a Binary Option refers to and the actual market prices of such an asset. Binary.com makes no warranty, expressed or implied, that the quoted prices represent prevailing market prices.</p><p>Binary.com may have access to information that is not available to the client, may have acquired trading positions at prices that are not available to the client, and may have interests different from the client&#x27;s interests. Binary.com does not undertake any obligation to provide the client with market or other information that the Company possesses, nor to alter or refrain from the Company&#x27;s own trading.</p><p>Information of the previous performance of any underlying instrument or asset does not guarantee its current and/or future performance. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.</p><h2 data-anchor="risks-of-investment-products">Risks of Investment Products</h2><p>Investing or trading in contracts exposes the client to the performance of the underlying or reference instrument or asset to which the Binary contract refers, including foreign exchange, stock indices, and commodities, each of which have their own features and risks.</p><p>Exchange rate risk: Exchange rates between foreign currencies can change rapidly due to a wide range of economic, political, and other conditions, exposing the client to the risk of exchange rate losses in addition to the inherent risk of loss from trading the underlying Investment Product. If the client deposits funds in a currency to trade contracts denominated in a different currency, the client&#x27;s gains or losses on the underlying investment may be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the currencies.</p><p>Other risks: There are other risks related to trading Investment Products and foreign currencies that cannot be described in detail in this document. Generally, however, securities, options, and currency transactions involve exposure to a combination of the following risk factors: market risk, credit risk, settlement risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. For example, there can be serious market disruptions if local or overseas economic, political, or other unforeseen events affect the market. In addition to these types of risk, there may be other factors such as accounting and tax treatment issues that the client should consider.</p><h2 data-anchor="market-opinions">Market opinions</h2><p>All opinions, news, research, analysis, prices, or other information contained on this website are provided as general market commentary and do not constitute investment advice.

The client should be aware of all costs and charges that apply to the client because they will affect the client&#x27;s profitability.</p></div></div><div id="risk-mt-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="risk-disclosure-statement">Risk disclosure statement</h2><p>This risk disclosure statement is not exhaustive and is not intended to constitute a comprehensive statement of all the risks to which the client might be exposed and does not describe all the risks inherent to forex and contracts for differences that exist now or which may arise in the future. Its objective is rather to provide the client with information, so that the client can reasonably understand the risks associated with forex and contracts for differences offered by Binary.com, as it is the Company&#x27;s intention to provide the client with the best possible trading experience.</p><h2 data-anchor="forex-and-cfd-high-risk">The high-risk and speculative nature of forex and CFDs</h2><p>Forex and contract-for-difference transactions involve a high degree of risk and are speculative because they allow the client to speculate on the short-term price movements of the underlying financial instruments. The client should not enter into forex and/or contract-for-difference transactions unless the client is able to sustain losses that exceed the client&#x27;s deposited funds. It is important for the client to understand that in order to realise any value from the client&#x27;s open positions, the client would have to enter into a corresponding transaction to close the client&#x27;s open positions and may find it difficult or impossible to do so under certain market conditions.</p><h2 data-anchor="execution-model">Execution model and counterparty risk</h2><p>Binary.com offers forex and contracts for differences via a series of models - either solely dealing on own account (dealing desk), or wholly hedging client orders with the Company&#x27;s liquidity providers (no-dealing desk), or a hybrid model, depending on the company with which the client has a contract. For the hybrid model, client orders are typically hedged when the total transaction volume exceeds a predefined threshold of risk tolerance level. For these execution models, Binary.com acts as the contractual counterparty to the transactions that the client enters into with the Company, as opposed to entering into a contractual counterparty with a central clearing house as would be the case with exchange-traded financial instruments. As such, counterparty risk exists. Counterparty risk refers to the risk of loss for clients resulting from the fact that the counterparty to the forex and/or contract-for-difference transaction that the client has entered into may default on its obligations prior to the final settlement of the transaction&#x27;s cash flow.</p><h2 data-anchor="leverage">Leverage</h2><p>Leverage, in the context of margin trading, refers to the use of margin to increase/amplify the value of a trade. Leverage is expressed as a ratio. A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that the client would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than the client&#x27;s margin. When the client invests in a leveraged product, the client&#x27;s profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e. the increased/amplified value of the client&#x27;s trade is determined based on the leverage ratio that the client has set for the client&#x27;s account.</p><p>Leverage can be used to generate returns that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction (the client&#x27;s margin). However, investments that have the potential to deliver greater investment returns carry higher levels of risk. This means that if the price movement is against the client&#x27;s favour, the client will suffer losses that are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction (the client&#x27;s margin).</p><h2 data-anchor="relationship-between-margin-and-leverage">Relationship between margin and leverage</h2><p>The leverage ratio refers to the number of times that the client&#x27;s margin (the amount set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance to open and maintain a transaction) can be &quot;leveraged&quot; to enter into a transaction. The denominator of the leverage ratio is always one. A 50:1 leverage is equivalent to a 2% margin requirement (1 divided by 50 = 2%). The leverage ratio that the Company/the client establishes will determine the amount of margin required. As leverage is inversely proportional to margin, as the leverage that the client sets for the client&#x27;s account gets lower, the margin required to be set aside from the client&#x27;s account balance (the client&#x27;s margin requirement) gets higher.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-stop-order">Risk of stop order</h2><p>The system fills orders on a first-in, first-out basis, i.e. based on the sequence of the order received, and this is beyond the Company&#x27;s control. As a result, the client may find it difficult or impossible to close a position at the intended price stipulated in the client&#x27;s stop order during certain market conditions. The placement of stop order by the client, though useful as a risk management tool, will not necessarily limit the client&#x27;s losses to the client&#x27;s intended amounts in the event of highly volatile trading conditions, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders, and there is uncertainty about the client&#x27;s possible exit price. In short, a stop order is not guaranteed because it cannot operate in all market circumstances.</p><h2 data-anchor="regular-monitoring">Regular monitoring of open positions</h2><p>Trading forex and contracts for differences carries a high level of risk and Binary.com does not monitor the open positions of the client&#x27;s account on the client&#x27;s behalf. It is the client&#x27;s responsibility to monitor the client&#x27;s open positions and understand the exposure of the client&#x27;s open positions whilst ensuring that the client&#x27;s exposure commensurate with the client&#x27;s risk appetite. Due to the cost associated with overnight open positions, the client should consider investing in the market of the instrument in which the client ordinarily transacts instead of investing in a CFD.</p><h2 data-anchor="risk-of-slippage">Risk of slippage</h2><p>Whilst the Company endeavours to open or close the transaction to which the client&#x27;s orders relate at the requested price, acting in accordance with the Company&#x27;s duty of best execution, there are times when, due to an increase in volatility or volume, orders may be subject to slippage. The difference between the order price and execution price when orders are filled is known as slippage. This means that the client&#x27;s order is not filled at the exact intended quoted price when the client places their order. Slippage is usually seen during periods of extremely high or low volatility and generally occurs during fundamental news releases or periods of limited liquidity. Slippages can result in either a positive slippage (more favourable to the client) or a negative slippage (less favourable to the client).</p><h2 data-anchor="external-forces">External forces</h2><p>The client&#x27;s forex and contract-for-difference transactions with Binary.com are linked to an underlying financial instrument, and the client will be exposed to price, currency exchange, interest rate, or other volatility of the market to which the client&#x27;s financial instrument is related to, especially if the market is of a jurisdiction that is foreign to the client. Forex and contract-for-difference trading over the Internet via an electronic trading platform is subject to data latency risk, which may result in delays in order execution.</p></div></div><div id="order-execution-binary-content" class="toggle-content invisible"><div><h2 data-anchor="summary-order-execution-policy">Summary of the order execution policy</h2><p>The Company has a general duty to conduct its business with the client honestly, fairly, and professionally and to act in the client&#x27;s best interests when opening and closing binary options trades with the client.</p><p>More specifically, when the Company enters into a Binary Option trade with the client (each, a &quot;Contract&quot;), the Company has a duty to provide the client with &#x27;best execution&#x27;. Best execution means that the Company must take reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result for the client when executing a client order. This document provides a summary of the Company&#x27;s best execution policy.</p><p data-show="eucountry">The client should note that the Company&#x27;s duty to provide the client with best execution does not apply to any gambling products that the client places with the Company when there is no underlying financial market.</p><p>This policy applies to clients classified as retail or professional. Clients classified as eligible counterparties are outside the scope of this policy.</p><h2 data-anchor="general">General</h2><p>The Company&#x27;s order execution policy comprises a set of procedures that are designed to obtain the best possible execution result for the client, subject to and taking into account the following factors:</p><ul><li>(a) The nature of the client&#x27;s Contracts</li><li>(b) The priorities that the client has identified for the Company in relation to entering into those Contracts</li><li>(c) The practices relating to the market in question, with the aim of producing a result that provides, in the Company&#x27;s view, the best balance across a range of sometimes conflicting factors</li></ul><p>The Company&#x27;s policy cannot provide a guarantee, however, that when entering into Contracts with the client, the price will always be better than one that is or might have been available elsewhere.</p><h2 data-anchor="order-execution">Order execution</h2><p>The Company is licensed to deal in derivatives on its own account. Client orders will be executed by the Company and the Company will always be the client&#x27;s sole execution venue for all of the trades a client makes in binary options. This means that the Company will always act as the client&#x27;s counterparty, wherein it takes the other side of the client&#x27;s trade. The clients should be aware that they are exposed to higher risks as all Binary Options contracts are traded on over-the-counter (OTC) markets, as opposed to regulated exchanges. This section of the policy will outline how the Company intends to comply with its best execution obligations.</p><h2 data-anchor="classes-of-instruments">Classes of instruments</h2><p>The Company offers binary options through its online interactive platform.</p><p>A binary option is a contract in which one party undertakes to pay the other party a specified amount if the value of a given asset changes in a specific direction within a predetermined period. The three major underlying asset classes for binary options offered by the Company are</p><ul class="bullet"><li>Forex</li><li>Stock Indices</li><li>Commodities</li></ul><h2 data-anchor="best-execution-factors">Best execution factors</h2><p>In relation to Contracts that the client enters into with the Company, the Company acts as principal and not as agent on the client&#x27;s behalf; therefore, the Company acts as the sole execution venue for the execution of the client&#x27;s Contracts.</p><p>The Company will mainly ensure best execution for the client by giving due consideration to the market price when calculating the Company&#x27;s Bid/Ask for the underlying reference product to which the client&#x27;s Contract relates. In order to ascertain the market price, the Company has access to a number of different data sources, which provide the Company with an objective view of the bids and offers available to arms&#x27; length traders.</p><p>In the case of some Contracts, there may be no functioning or open market or exchange on which the reference product is traded at the time of the client order. In such cases, the Company sets out to determine a fair underlying price based on a number of factors, such as price movements on associated markets and other market influences and information about the client order.</p><p>The Company is required to take a number of factors into account when considering how to give the client best execution, specifically:</p><ul><li>(a) Price and cost<p>The Company has internally set appropriate controls and monitoring to verify that its aggregate return on various underlying options and durations is equal to its commission charge of 3 - 5%. Proper back-testing is conducted on a quarterly basis to certify that the Company&#x27;s return does not exceed this set mark-up and hence ascertain continued fair prices to the clientele, whilst mitigating the Company&#x27;s conflicts of interest.</p></li><li>(b) Speed<p>Due to the online nature of the business and instruments, there is a small delay between an order being entered and the same order being executed on the server. Any significant delay can have negative impacts on clients; therefore, the Company monitors the latency between the entering and execution of client orders. Should this delay exceed the established threshold, then the system administrators will be notified so that they can investigate any possible issue.</p></li><li>(c) Likelihood of execution<p>The Company strives to ensure that all the orders placed are executed; however, this is not always possible due to material difficulty or unusual circumstances. In any instance that the Company is aware of any material difficulty relevant to the proper execution of an order, it promptly informs the client of the issue.</p></li><li>(d) Likelihood of settlement<p>During volatile markets, the Company&#x27;s trading platform runs across a high number of concurrent online users, high volumes of client orders, and a high number of imported price ticks.  As part of the Company&#x27;s best execution delivery to its clients, the Company ensures that its platform runs smoothly under such stressed conditions and takes all reasonable steps to safeguard the continuity and regularity in the performance of investment activities.</p></li><li>(e) Size and nature<p>Orders will generally be auto-accepted if they do not take the Company over exposure limits and the client has enough remaining balance in their account. With every contract purchased, the Company has systems in place that automatically carry out a large exposure check, and, in case the new total exposure result is greater than or equal to 25% of the eligible capital, the contract cannot be sold to the client.</p></li></ul><h2 data-anchor="specific-instructions">Specific instructions</h2><p>When the client gives the Company specific instructions, including (a) specifying the price of a Contract with the Company or (b) specifying the price at which a Contract is to be closed, then those instructions take precedence over other aspects of the Company&#x27;s policy.</p><h2 data-anchor="no-fiduciary-duty">No fiduciary duty</h2><p>The Company&#x27;s commitment to provide the client with &#x27;best execution&#x27; does not mean that the Company owes the client any fiduciary responsibilities over and above the specific regulatory obligations placed upon the Company or as may be otherwise contracted between the Company and the client.</p><h2 data-anchor="monitoring-and-review">Monitoring and review of this policy</h2><p>The Company will monitor the effectiveness of its order execution arrangements and order execution policy.
