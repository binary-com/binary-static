Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes and allow you to take a simple \"Yes or No\" approach. Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, indexes or stocks, however one of the most significant differences from traditional options, among others, is that there can be only two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount as determined in each option."

Trading cryptocurrency contracts for differences is highly speculative investment because prices of cryptocurrencies can go up and down &mdash; potentially to a worthless (zero) value. Investing in cryptocurrency contracts for differences through leveraged accounts amplifies this underlying volatility risk, making the change in prices even more significant. When you invest in a leveraged contract for differences related to cryptocurrencies, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged ratio you set for your account. If the price movement is in your favour, returns generated are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction. However, if the price movement is against your favour, you will suffer losses that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction. You should not trade in cryptocurrencies unless you fully understand and are aware that trades and / or investments involving cryptocurrencies are complex and high risk in nature and you not only risk incurring significant losses over a short period of time but also risk losing all your invested capital."
