msgid "\"Binary\" or \"digital\" options are options that pay a pre-determined, fixed amount, depending on whether or not an event occurs at the time the Binary Option expires. Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes and allow you to take a simple \"Yes or No\" approach. Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, indexes or stocks, however one of the most significant differences from traditional options, among others, is that there can be only two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount as determined in each option."
msgstr "“二元”或“数字”期权是支付已预定和固定金额的期权，支付与否根据二元期权到期时某事件发生与否而定。二元期权只能在两个可能性中产生一个最后结果，并让您简单地挑选“是”或“否”。像传统期权一样，二元期权也是根据如货币、大宗商品、指数或股票等标的资产。但是跟传统期权最大的不同点，就是二元期权只会有两种结果。要么就是事件发生，客户因此获得回报，不然就是客户损失每项期权已预定的投资金额。"

A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that you would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than your margin. When you invest in a leveraged product, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e., the increased/amplified value of your trade determined based on the leverage ratio you set for your account."
msgstr "融资融券交易中，杠杆指使用保证金增加/扩大交易数值。杠杆的表达方式是比率。举个例子，如果杠杆是50: 1，您将能够持有比保证金高出 50 倍的交易头寸。当您投资一种杠杆产品时，您的盈利或亏损将根据杠杆的头寸计算，也就是说，您为账户设置的杠杆比率决定了您的交易增加/扩大数值。"
