msgid "In exceptional circumstances, where there is a price change in the underlying that is sufficiently large and sudden, gapping can occur. In such cases, the automatic Margin close-out protection might fail, causing the client's Account Balance to fall below zero. For this purpose, a Negative Balance Protection mechanism has been introduced. Negative Balance Protection provides a 'backstop' in case of extreme market conditions and ensures that the client's maximum losses from trading CFDs, including all related costs, are limited to the balance available on the client's CFD account. Therefore, the client can never lose more money than the total sum invested for trading CFDs; if the client's CFD account balance falls below zero, the Company will compensate the negative balance as soon as possible without any additional cost to the client."

A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that the client would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than the client's margin. When the client invests in a leveraged product, the client's profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e. the increased/amplified value of the client's trade is determined based on the leverage ratio that the client has set for the client's account."
msgstr "融資融券交易中，槓桿指使用保證金增加/擴大交易數值。槓桿的表達方式是比率。舉個例子，如果槓桿是50: 1，客戶將能夠持有比保證金高出 50 倍的交易頭寸。當客戶投資一種槓桿產品時，其盈利或虧損將根據槓桿的頭寸計算，也就是說，客戶為帳戶設定的槓桿比率決定了其交易增加/擴大數值。"
