msgid "\"Binary\" or \"digital\" options are options that pay a pre-determined, fixed amount, depending on whether or not an event occurs at the time the Binary Option expires. Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes and allow you to take a simple \"Yes or No\" approach. Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, indexes or stocks, however one of the most significant differences from traditional options, among others, is that there can be only two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount as determined in each option."
msgstr "「二元」或「數字」期權是支付已預定和固定金額的期權，支付與否是根據二元期權到期時某事件是否發生而定。二元期權只能在兩個可能中出現一個最後結果，並讓您簡單地挑選「是」或「否」。就像傳統期權一樣，二元期權也是根據如貨幣、商品、指數或股票等標的資產。但是傳統期權最大的不同點是，二元期權只會有兩種結果。要麼事件發生，客戶因此獲得回報，要麼客戶損失每項期權已預定的投資金額。"

msgid "Cryptocurrencies are volatile assets that are extremely vulnerable to market fluctuations. Trading cryptocurrency contracts for differences is highly speculative investment because prices of cryptocurrencies can go up and down &mdash; potentially to a worthless (zero) value. Investing in cryptocurrency contracts for differences through leveraged accounts amplifies this underlying volatility risk, making the change in prices even more significant. When you invest in a leveraged contract for differences related to cryptocurrencies, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged ratio you set for your account. If the price movement is in your favour, returns generated are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction. However, if the price movement is against your favour, you will suffer losses that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction. You should not trade in cryptocurrencies unless you fully understand and are aware that trades and / or investments involving cryptocurrencies are complex and high risk in nature and you not only risk incurring significant losses over a short period of time but also risk losing all your invested capital."

However, investments that have the potential to deliver greater investment returns carry higher levels of risk. This means that if the price movement is against your favour, you will suffer losses that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction (your margin)."
msgstr "槓桿可以用於生成比從您的帳戶餘額撥出進行開盤持倉交易（您的保證金）的金額高出多倍的回報。然而，進行可能帶來更大投資回報的投資具更高風險。這意味著，如果價格走勢對您不利，您將蒙受比從您的帳戶餘額撥出進行開盤持倉交易（您的保證金）的金額高出多倍的虧損。"

msgid "Leverage, in the context of margin trading, refers to the use of margin to increase/amplify the value of a trade. Leverage is expressed as a ratio. A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that you would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than your margin. When you invest in a leveraged product, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e., the increased/amplified value of your trade determined based on the leverage ratio you set for your account."
msgstr "融資融券交易中，槓桿指使用保證金增加/擴大交易數值。槓桿的表達方式是比率。舉個例子，如果槓桿是50: 1，您將能夠持有比保證金高出 50 倍的交易頭寸。當您投資一種槓桿產品時，您的盈利或虧損將根據槓桿的頭寸計算，也就是說，您為帳戶設定的槓桿比率決定了您的交易增加/擴大數值。"

During weekends, the forex markets may occasionally generate prices, however these prices are often artificial (traders sometimes take advantage of the illiquidity of the markets during weekends to push up or down prices). To avoid settling prices based on such artificial prices, it is %1's policy not to count weekend prices towards contract settlement values (except for the volatility indices, which are open during weekends)."
msgstr "請注意，為進行合約結算，週末報價將忽略不計。週末，外匯交易市場也許會偶爾產生價格，但這些價格只是人為的（交易商有時會利用周末市場缺乏流動性而抬高或壓低價格）。為了避免結算價格基於這些人為價格，%1的政策就是在合約結算時不計算週末報價（波動率指數除外，因為這些指數週末也開放）。"
