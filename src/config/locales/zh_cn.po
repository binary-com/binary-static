msgid "\"Binary\" or \"digital\" options are options that pay a pre-determined, fixed amount, depending on whether or not an event occurs at the time the Binary Option expires. Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes and allow you to take a simple \"Yes or No\" approach. Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, indexes or stocks, however one of the most significant differences from traditional options, among others, is that there can be only two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount as determined in each option."
msgstr "“二元”或“数字”期权是支付已预定和固定金额的期权，支付与否根据二元期权到期时某事件发生与否而定。二元期权只能在两个可能性中产生一个最后结果，并让您简单地挑选“是”或“否”。像传统期权一样，二元期权也是根据如货币、大宗商品、指数或股票等标的资产。但是跟传统期权最大的不同点，就是二元期权只会有两种结果。要么就是事件发生，客户因此获得回报，不然就是客户损失每项期权已预定的投资金额。"

For both execution models, %1 acts as the contractual counterparty to the transactions that you enter into with us, as opposed to entering into a contractual counterparty with a central clearing house as would be the case with exchange traded financial instruments.

A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that you would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than your margin. When you invest in a leveraged product, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e., the increased/amplified value of your trade determined based on the leverage ratio you set for your account."
msgstr "融资融券交易中，杠杆指使用保证金增加/扩大交易数值。杠杆的表达方式是比率。举个例子，如果杠杆是50: 1，您将能够持有比保证金高出 50 倍的交易头寸。当您投资一种杠杆产品时，您的盈利或亏损将根据杠杆的头寸计算，也就是说，您为账户设置的杠杆比率决定了您的交易增加/扩大数值。"

The RSI ranges between 0 and 100.A 70+ level could indicate that a share is overbought, meaning that the speculator should consider selling. Or conversely oversold at the 30 level. The principle is that when there's a high proportion of daily movement in one direction it suggests an extreme, and prices are likely to reverse."

Unlike real market stock indices whose prices depend on the prices of the individual stocks listed on an Exchange, the random stock index only relies on factors like volatility, previous index price (previous simulated price) and a random number to determine the price of the index. Due to the use of random numbers, the price (or direction) of the index cannot be predicted with certainty and thus behaves like a real market index. When the index is appended with a number, the number is the percentage volatility used in calculating the index price. For instance, the Random Index 25 uses a volatility of 25% in the calculation of the index price. The index started at 1000 on 16 May 2004."
#~ msgstr "“随机指数”是价格由随机数字模拟得出的股票指数。真正的股票指数点位取决于交易所上市的单个股票的价格，但随机股票指数的点位只取决于波动性、前指数点位（前一模拟价格）和一个随机号码。由于使用的是随机数字，随机指数的点位（或走势）无法准确预测，因此它的表现与真实市场相似。当指数跟有一个数字，该数字将被采用为计算指数点位的波动性百分比。比如说，随机指数 25 采用25% 的波动性来计算指数点位。在 2004 年 5 月 16 日该指数始于 1000。"

The calculation will include a bias in favour of the Company. The financial contract prices (or the payout amounts) offered to Clients speculating on market or index prices may differ substantially from prices available in the primary markets where stock indices or commodities or contracts thereupon are traded, due to the bias favouring the Company in the price calculation system referred to above. The charting data made available to Clients by the Company is indicative only and may at times differ from the real market values. The Company's decision as to the calculation of a financial contract price will be final and binding.

Conversely, buy when price moves down to a new low but the Stochastic does not make a new low (positive divergence).  On the above chart, the Stochastic is computed on a %1 %2 basis."

#~ "<p>Our patented technology lets you define your own parameters. You tell us what you want to trade. We price the trade in real-time using live market data. We also act as market makers so you always have someone to take the other side of the trade. No matter which position you want to take in the markets, we'll price it.</p>\n"

They are all traded from the same account using the same familiar interface, so you can pick whichever is right for you whenever it&rsquo;s right for you.</p>\n"

#~ "<h2>Multiple Trade Types to Take Advantage of Different Market Conditions</h2>\n"
#~ "<p>With %1' flexible fixed-odds platform, you're not limited to simply 'Up' or 'Down' . You choose the way you think the market will move. We offer options that allow you to profit whether the market is rising or falling, range-bound or volatile.</p>\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "<h2>Tax Free Profits</h2>\n"
#~ "<p>Fixed odds trading is classified as trading. In many jurisdictions, this means that all returns are tax-free. The money you save goes directly into your pocket. The price you're quoted for a contract is exactly the price you pay and your winnings are yours alone.</p>"

#~ msgid "The random walk is a stock index whose price is simulated using random numbers. Unlike real market stock indices whose prices depend on the prices of the individual stocks listed on the Exchange, the random stock index only relies on factors like volatility, previous index price (previous simulated price) and a random number to determine the price of the index. Due to the use of random numbers, the price (or direction) of the index cannot be predicted with certainty and thus behaves like a real market index. When the index is appended with a number, the number is the percentage volatility which would be used in the calculation of the index price. For instance, for the Random Index 25 we use a volatility of 25% in the calculation of the index price. The index started at 1000 on 16-May-2004."

As a result of this change, you will no longer be restricted to placing Run Bets just on the Random Index.</p><p>We're also pleased to announce that, clients may now choose higher stakes when placing Run Bets. The maximum stake has now increased from 200 USD/EUR/GBP/AUD to 2,500 USD/EUR/GBP/AUD. This means that you may now make up to 25,000 USD/EUR/GBP/AUD on the Lucky 10 digits! Higher stakes are available across all run bet types and on all market options, including the two new forex additions.</p><h2><span title=\"2011-11-15\" class=\"RSSDate\">15 November 2011 - Changes to Selling Options Effective 17th November 2011.</span></h2><p>Please note that effective 17th November 2011, there may be instances where you are unable to sell your trade prior to expiry. As always, your best indication as to whether a bet can be sold before expiry is whether an offsetting bet is available for purchase. Â For instance, if one buys a Touch/No Touch bet with a minimum duration of 7 days on the UK Index, that Touch/No Touch bet will not be eligible for sale before its expiration date, since such similar bets are not provided on the site.</p><p>Most of our customers prefer the excitement of seeing their bet through to conclusion, so the experience will remain largely unchanged for the majority of players. However, there may be other players whose trading strategy may be affected by these changes. We'd like to reassure these players that Â these changes are being implemented with the sole purpose of improving our overall pricing on both the buy and sell side.</p><p>These changes do not apply to forward-starting bets which may still be sold before the bets start.</p><h2><span title=\"2011-10-31\" class=\"RSSDate\">31 October 2011 - Commissions reduced for the Run Bet Up/Down.</span></h2><p>##SITENAME## is pleased to announced that it has reduced the commission rate on the Run Bet Up/Down trade from 5% to 2.5%. As a result of this change in commission structure, ##SITENAME## will be removing the Up/Down game. This is due to the fact that the new commission rate on the Run Bet Up/Down trade is now lower and much more competitive compared to the Up/Down game.</p><h2><span title=\"2011-10-28\" class=\"RSSDate\">28 October 2011 - New Auto-Sell Function.</span></h2><p>True to our promise of introducing more and more changes to improve our award-winning platform, we have now introduced changes to the auto-sell feature so as to improve its function. Bets will be sold automatically by the system within approximately one or two hours after a bet expires. This means that, unless you want to claim your winnings immediately after the bet has expired, you will no longer need to claim your winnings manually.</p><h2><span title=\"2011-09-27\" class=\"RSSDate\">27 September 2011 - New Mini-Statement Feature.</span></h2><p>We're pleased to let you know that we've added a \"Most Recent Account Activity\" mini-statement on the \"My Account\" page.
