msgid "\"Binary\" or \"digital\" options are options that pay a pre-determined, fixed amount, depending on whether or not an event occurs at the time the Binary Option expires. Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes and allow you to take a simple \"Yes or No\" approach. Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, indexes or stocks, however one of the most significant differences from traditional options, among others, is that there can be only two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount as determined in each option."
msgstr "「二元」或「數字」期權是支付已預定和固定金額的期權，支付與否是根據二元期權到期時某事件是否發生而定。二元期權只能在兩個可能中出現一個最後結果，並讓您簡單地挑選「是」或「否」。就像傳統期權一樣，二元期權也是根據如貨幣、商品、指數或股票等標的資產。但是傳統期權最大的不同點是，二元期權只會有兩種結果。要麼事件發生，客戶因此獲得回報，要麼客戶損失每項期權已預定的投資金額。"

msgid "Let's say the points adjustment for a short position on the EUR/USD symbol is 1.64. This would result in an overnight credit of 1.64 points for one lot of open position in EUR/USD where the size of one lot is 100,000 units. The points will then be converted into the deposit currency (which is the euro in this example). As a result, you will be credited with EUR1.64 for keeping the position open overnight."
msgstr "比如說，歐元/美元符號的空頭頭寸點調整是1.64。如果一手大小是 100,000單位，歐元/美元持倉頭寸帶來 1.64 點過夜信貸。點數將被轉換成存款貨幣（在這個例子中是歐元）。因此，持倉過夜可獲取 1.64 歐元隔夜信貸。"

msgid "Leverage"

msgid "Leverage can be used to generate returns that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction (your margin). However, investments that have the potential to deliver greater investment returns carry higher levels of risk. This means that if the price movement is against your favour, you will suffer losses that are of multiple times higher than the amount set aside from your account balance to open and maintain a transaction (your margin)."
msgstr "槓桿可以用於生成比從您的帳戶餘額撥出進行開盤持倉交易（您的保證金）的金額高出多倍的回報。然而，進行可能帶來更大投資回報的投資具更高風險。這意味著，如果價格走勢對您不利，您將蒙受比從您的帳戶餘額撥出進行開盤持倉交易（您的保證金）的金額高出多倍的虧損。"

msgid "Leverage indicates how much capital you can control based on your initial deposit. For example, a 100:1 leverage will allow you to control up to USD 100,000 using only USD 1,000 of your own money as deposit."

msgid "Leverage, in the context of margin trading, refers to the use of margin to increase/amplify the value of a trade. Leverage is expressed as a ratio. A 50:1 leverage, for example, means that you would be able to enter into a trade position that is of 50 times higher than your margin. When you invest in a leveraged product, your profit or loss is based on the leveraged position, i.e., the increased/amplified value of your trade determined based on the leverage ratio you set for your account."
msgstr "融資融券交易中，槓桿指使用保證金增加/擴大交易數值。槓桿的表達方式是比率。舉個例子，如果槓桿是50: 1，您將能夠持有比保證金高出 50 倍的交易頭寸。當您投資一種槓桿產品時，您的盈利或虧損將根據槓桿的頭寸計算，也就是說，您為帳戶設定的槓桿比率決定了您的交易增加/擴大數值。"

#~ msgid "The Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures a share price relative to itself and its recent history. It is calculated as the average of the prices for days where the price rose divided by the average of the prices for days where the price fell. The RSI ranges between 0 and 100.A 70+ level could indicate that a share is overbought, meaning that the speculator should consider selling. Or conversely oversold at the 30 level. The principle is that when there's a high proportion of daily movement in one direction it suggests an extreme, and prices are likely to reverse."
#~ msgstr "相對強弱指標(RSI)衡量股票價格相對自身以及近期走勢的表現。它的計算方法為用價格上漲時的多日價格平均數除以價格下跌時的價格平均數。 RSI範圍為0至100。高於70即顯示股票超買，意味著投機者可能考慮賣出股票。相反，RSI的值為30時表示超賣。這其中的原則是，當某天出現某個方向的高比例移動，就意味著一個極限，價格很可能出現反轉。"

Unlike real market stock indices whose prices depend on the prices of the individual stocks listed on an Exchange, the random stock index only relies on factors like volatility, previous index price (previous simulated price) and a random number to determine the price of the index. Due to the use of random numbers, the price (or direction) of the index cannot be predicted with certainty and thus behaves like a real market index. When the index is appended with a number, the number is the percentage volatility used in calculating the index price. For instance, the Random Index 25 uses a volatility of 25% in the calculation of the index price. The index started at 1000 on 16 May 2004."
#~ msgstr "「隨機指數」是價格由隨機數字模擬得出的股票指數。真正的股票指數點位取決於交易所上市的單個股票的價格，但隨機股票指數的點位只取決於波動性、前指數點位（前一模擬價格）和一個隨機號碼。由於使用的是隨機數字，隨機指數的點位（或走勢）無法準確預測，因此它的表現與真實市場相似。當指數附有一個數字，該數字將被採用為計算指數點位的波動性百分比。比如說，隨機指數25 採用25% 的波動性來計算指數點位。在 2004 年 5 月 16 日該指數始於 1000。"
