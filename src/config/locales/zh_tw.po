msgid "\"Binary\" or \"digital\" options are options that pay a pre-determined, fixed amount, depending on whether or not an event occurs at the time the Binary Option expires. Binary Options can have only one of two possible outcomes and allow you to take a simple \"Yes or No\" approach. Like traditional options, Binary Options are based on an underlying asset such as currencies, commodities, indexes or stocks, however one of the most significant differences from traditional options, among others, is that there can be only two outcomes for the option, either the client is paid the return upon the occurrence of the event, or the client loses the investment amount as determined in each option."
msgstr "「二元」或「數字」期權是支付已預定和固定金額的期權，支付與否是根據二元期權到期時某事件是否發生而定。二元期權只能在兩個可能中出現一個最後結果，並讓您簡單地挑選「是」或「否」。就像傳統期權一樣，二元期權也是根據如貨幣、商品、指數或股票等標的資產。但是傳統期權最大的不同點是，二元期權只會有兩種結果。要麼事件發生，客戶因此獲得回報，要麼客戶損失每項期權已預定的投資金額。"

Three lines are shown. The \"MACD\" line is calculated as the difference between the two moving averages (usually based on 12- and 26- day averages). The \"signal\" line is a 9-day smoothed average of the standard MACD line, and is sometimes referred to as the \"slow\" MACD line."

#~ msgid "The Performance indicator displays a security's price performance as a percentage. This is sometimes called a \"normalized\" chart.

Similarly, a value of -10% means that the security's price has fallen by 10% since the first period displayed.Performance charts are helpful for comparing the price movements of different securities."
#~ msgstr "效能指標以百分比的形式顯示股票價格效能，有時候又被稱為「標準化」圖表。該指標表示自顯示首期以來股票上漲的百分比。比如，如果效能指標為10，意味著股票價格在圖表左側顯示首期後上漲了10%。同理，-10%意味著價格的股票自顯示首期後下跌了10%。效能圖表非常有助於比較不同股票的價格變動。"

#~ msgid "The Rate of Change indicator (ROC) is a way of showing how rapidly the price of a particular share (or other financial instrument) is moving. The theory is that if a price is rising (or falling) very quickly there will soon come a time when it is thought to be overbought (or oversold). When this occurs the price may still continue to rise (or fall), but not as rapidly as it was before."
#~ msgstr "變動率指標(ROC) 是顯示特定股票（或其它金融工具）的價格變動速率的一種指標。從理論上講，若價格快速上漲（或下跌），將會很快出現超買（或超賣）。當發生這樣的情況時，價格可能仍然持續上漲（或下跌），但不會再像之前那樣迅速。"

#~ msgid "The Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures a share price relative to itself and its recent history. It is calculated as the average of the prices for days where the price rose divided by the average of the prices for days where the price fell. The RSI ranges between 0 and 100.A 70+ level could indicate that a share is overbought, meaning that the speculator should consider selling. Or conversely oversold at the 30 level. The principle is that when there's a high proportion of daily movement in one direction it suggests an extreme, and prices are likely to reverse."
#~ msgstr "相對強弱指標(RSI)衡量股票價格相對自身以及近期走勢的表現。它的計算方法為用價格上漲時的多日價格平均數除以價格下跌時的價格平均數。 RSI範圍為0至100。高於70即顯示股票超買，意味著投機者可能考慮賣出股票。相反，RSI的值為30時表示超賣。這其中的原則是，當某天出現某個方向的高比例移動，就意味著一個極限，價格很可能出現反轉。"

#~ msgid "The Stochastic Oscillator is a momentum indicator that shows the location of the current close relative to the high/low range over a set number of periods. The Stochastic Oscillator is made up of two lines that oscillate between a vertical scale of 0 to 100. The %K is the main line and it is drawn as a solid line.

Unlike real market stock indices whose prices depend on the prices of the individual stocks listed on an Exchange, the random stock index only relies on factors like volatility, previous index price (previous simulated price) and a random number to determine the price of the index. Due to the use of random numbers, the price (or direction) of the index cannot be predicted with certainty and thus behaves like a real market index. When the index is appended with a number, the number is the percentage volatility used in calculating the index price. For instance, the Random Index 25 uses a volatility of 25% in the calculation of the index price. The index started at 1000 on 16 May 2004."
#~ msgstr "「隨機指數」是價格由隨機數字模擬得出的股票指數。真正的股票指數點位取決於交易所上市的單個股票的價格，但隨機股票指數的點位只取決於波動性、前指數點位（前一模擬價格）和一個隨機號碼。由於使用的是隨機數字，隨機指數的點位（或走勢）無法準確預測，因此它的表現與真實市場相似。當指數附有一個數字，該數字將被採用為計算指數點位的波動性百分比。比如說，隨機指數25 採用25% 的波動性來計算指數點位。在 2004 年 5 月 16 日該指數始於 1000。"
